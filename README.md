# Trying to understand and learn to code
I just hope that I can learn a lot and don't look like a fool :)
To start the next week on monday this repo will be used to save the work done while trying to understand js.

After several learnings I have decided to put all the done patchwork work into the archive and beging with the weekly projects from scratch! The whole (and very nessecary) work on html 5 and css 3 cluttered this repo.

Let's hope it will provide more order and get rid of the chaos.
