            We will be looking at styles, selectors, declarations, etc.
            We will build a CSS cheat sheet that you can keep as a resource
            and we will also create a basic website layout. We are using CSS3 
            but mostly the basics. I will be creating an advanced CSS course with animations,
            etc. I do have a Flexbox in 20 minutes video as well if you want to learn flexbox."</p>
